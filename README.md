# About BehaviorTree.CPP

This  __C++__ library provides a framework to create BehaviorTrees.
It was designed to be flexible, easy to use, reactive and fast.

Even if our main use-case is __robotics__, you can use this library to build
__AI for games__, or to replace Finite State Machines in you application.

__BehaviorTree.CPP__ has many interesting features, when compared to other implementations:

- It makes asynchronous Actions, i.e. non-blocking, a first-class citizen.

- You can build reactive behaviors that execute multiple Actions concurrently.

- It allows the creation of Trees at run-time, using a textual representation (XML);
the fact that is written in C++ __does not__ imply that Trees are hard-coded.

- You can link staticaly you custom TreeNodes or convert them into plugins 
which are loaded at run-time.

- It includes a __logging/profiling__ infrastructure that allows the user 
to visualize, record, replay and analyze state transitions.

- It provides a type-safe and flexible mechanism to do dataflow between
  Nodes of the Tree.

# About version 3.X

The main goal of this project is to create a Behavior Tree implementation
that uses the principles of Model Driven Development to separate the role 
of the __Component Developer__ from the __Behavior Designer__.

In practice, this means that:

- Custom TreeNodes must be reusable building blocks. 
 You should be able to implement them once and reuse them in many contextes.

- To build a Behavior Tree out of TreeNodes, the Behavior Designer must 
not need to read nor modify the source code of the a given TreeNode.

Version 3 of this library introduce some dramatic changes in the API, but 
it was necessary to reach this goal.

if you used version 2.X in the past, you can find

# GUI Editor

Editing a BehaviorTree is as simple as editing a XML file in your favourite text editor.

If you are looking for a more fancy graphical user interface, check 
[Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) out.

# How to compile

On Ubuntu, you must install the following dependencies:

     sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libdw-dev
     
Any other dependency is already included in the __3rdparty__ folder.

## Catkin and ROS users

You can easily install the package with the command

      sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-behaviortree-cpp
      
If you want to compile it with catkin, you __must__ include this package 
to your catkin workspace.

# Acknowledgement

This library was developed at  **Eurecat** (main author, Davide Faconti) in a joint effort
with the **Italian Institute of Technology** (Michele Colledanchise).

It is one of the main components of [MOOD2Be](https://eurecat.org/es/portfolio-items/mood2be/),
which is one of the six **Integrated Technical Projects (ITPs)** selected from the
[RobMoSys first open call](https://robmosys.eu/itp/) and it received funding from the European
Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.
