ros-kinetic-behaviortree-cpp-v3 (3.2.0-1xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * fixed compilation on ROS2 and ubuntu 18.94
  * fix compilation and unit tests
  * Boost coroutine (#164 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/164>)

  * Tree is declared as a struct, so it needs to be forward-declared as a struct too.
  * Merge pull request #161 <https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/161> from unvestigate/master
    A couple of small changes needed to build on MSVC2015
  * The __cplusplus macro does not work properly prior to MSVC2017 15.7 Preview 3: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/msvc-now-correctly-reports-__cplusplus/
  * MSVC2015 seems to need an explicit operator== for comparing against literal strings.
  * [Breaking API change] make TreeNode::setStatus() protected
    Users are not supposed to set the status of a node manually from the
    outside. This might be a source of hard to debug errors as seen in
    Navigation2 of ROS2.
    If this change breaks your code, there is an high probability that your
    code was already broken.

    Fix error message
  * Modify documentation images.
    SequenceNode:
    AimTo -> AimAt
    "Aim at a target" might sound more appropriate in this example than "aim to reach a goal".
    SequenceStar:
    Sequence -> ReactiveSequence
    The text says "On the other hand, isBatteryOK must be checked at every tick,
    for this reason its parent must be a ReactiveSequence."
    Modify the image to match the text.
